# bananaKeeper
keeps track of banana sales


server - exports.buy in bananas.js
moment(buyDate).isValid() doesn't really work

input form in buy and sell are somewhat redundant.  The form could be extracted as a component and used in both places.
however, this coding challenge only requires two of them, and making it a common component would add complexity that is out of scope.
